# C# Assignment - AOLCC

This repository contains my C# assignment for the Academy of Learning Career College (AOLCC).

## Overview

This project is a console-based application designed to provide a shipping quote for packages based on their weight and dimensions. The application follows these steps:

1. Prompts the user to enter the package weight.
2. If the weight exceeds 50 units, an error message is displayed and the application exits.
3. Prompts the user to enter the package width, height, and length.
4. If the total dimensions exceed 50 units, an error message is displayed and the application exits.
5. Calculates the shipping quote based on the entered dimensions and weight.
6. Displays the calculated shipping quote to the user.

## Usage

To use this application, clone the repository and compile the `Program.cs` file using a C# compiler. After compiling, run the executable to start the application.
